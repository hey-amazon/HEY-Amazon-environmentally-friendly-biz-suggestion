# HEY, Amazon! - Open Letter to Amazon
Hey, Jeff, I have an idea, please listen.

Here's the idea:

Please don't put any more items meant for consumers to waste just because you couldn't store them any longer.

I would like all governments to force you and your fellow managers Jeff to think more responsibly, clearly you haven't done that enough.

Instead, do this: Offer an addon subscription for 4.99 EUR/USD for Prime customers.

Upon subscribing one can select what type of items one wants sent from the items that are being thrown out.

I also wanna provide you with an advertisment promo text for this great option.
